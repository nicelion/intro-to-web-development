# Introduction to the Command Line

**Learning objective:** By the end of this module, you will

- Understand what the command line is
- What purpose thee command line serves
- Basic computer interaction using the command line
- Know how to execute basic system commands

## What is the command line?

The command line, specifically in the context of Unix-like operating systems, refers to a text-based interface that allows users to interact with their computer's operating system by entering commands directly into a terminal emulator. Unlike graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that rely on visual elements like windows and icons, the command line operates entirely through text commands.

In the Unix command line, users type commands using a specific syntax, consisting of a command followed by options and arguments. Commands can perform a wide range of tasks, including file management, system configuration, software installation, and more. Unix-like systems, such as Linux, macOS, and various Unix distributions, provide a powerful and efficient environment for both novice and advanced users to control their computers.

## Accessing the command line

To access the command line on a Mac, you will use the "Terminal" application. You can open this application by searching in your applications directory or by typing `CMD+SPACE` to open Spotlight and then typing in "Terminal".

Personally, I use a third party terminal interface called "iTerm2." It functions the _exact_ same way as the default terminal application, but offers a few more advanced features.

It is not necessary to download this application, but you are certainly welcome to.

Any images of the terminal throughout this demo will be using iTerm, so it may look slightly different

### Let's open up the command line!

As I previously described, go ahead and open up your terminal environment

You will be greeted with a blank terminal and are now ready to start entering commands.
